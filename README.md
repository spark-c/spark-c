# Hello! My name is Collin Sparks.

## I'm looking for work! If you're looking for a developer who's eager to get involved with your team, then reach out; I've got a lot I'd love to talk about :) 

I'm a dance and theatre nerd who also happens to love working with computers! I've spent well over a decade involved with ballet, tap, acting, stage management, and lighting design for the stage.

Now I'm focused on learning to create high-quality (and _useful!_) software; theatrical production and application development are incredibly similar processes and I'm really delighted about that. A lot of the _most fun_ parts of the former are also in the latter!  

Solving a problem is super motivating for me -- and I love when I'm able to see real results from my work!


## Current Work - "Solo" and lots of (py)testing!

I'm highly exited to be working on a collaborative project right now called **"Solo"**! The repository is hosted privately on BitBucket, but I am more than happy to talk about our progress :)

Myself and 2 other developers are building a SaaS-scale application, and I'm having a great time on it. So far, my friend (more senior than I) is focusing on the detailed project-management side, I am implementing the foundation to the codebase, and the third developer is more junior / learning.

I feel very good about the organization and state of the project. It's refreshing to work alongside other developers!

I also have been working on an [open-source PR](https://github.com/chicagopython/chipy.org/pull/422) lately that has been a lot of fun and a great experience learning about Django. I'm going to be working on more OSS in the near future :)

## Other Work

Early in 2021, I "finished" my [*web-contact-converter*](https://github.com/spark-c/web-contact-converter) project, and I'm super happy to have deployed it as my largest / most-useful complete full-stack web app.

Later, I shifted to other projects e.g. extending my [discord bot](https://github.com/spark-c/baby-bot), and practicing React.js (with my [personal site](https://spark-c.github.io) and my [coffee calculator](https://coffee-calculator-nine.vercel.app))! Repos [here](https://github.com/spark-c/spark-c.github.io) and [here](https://github.com/spark-c/coffee-calculator) respectively.

And lots of other smaller experiments as well :)
