# Hello! My name is Collin Sparks.

I'm a dance and theatre nerd who also happens to love working with computers. There's always more to learn in terms of software and technologies, and it is _amazing_ to me when I see all of the innovative ways that tech has been, and continues to be, improved; I am humbled to see the ways that people have used software as a means to overcome frightening obstacles in their lives and communities.

Solving a problem is super motivating for me -- and I love when I'm able to see real results from my work!

I recently "finished" my [*web-contact-converter*](https://github.com/spark-c/web-contact-converter) project, and I'm SUPER proud to have deployed it as my first complete full-stack web app.

For now, I've shifted to my [*py-garden*](https://github.com/spark-c/py-garden) project, which is challenging my knowledge of project structure / imports, and savvy class inheritance.

Please reach out to me if you have any comments about my code, or if you'd like to collaborate on any project! I'd love to hear from absolutlely anyone.
I can best be reached by email at cklsparks@gmail.com, Twitter [@collin_sparkles](https://twitter.com/collin_sparkles), or on Discord "spark.c#7001"

Cheers!
