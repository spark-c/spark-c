# Hello! My name is Collin Sparks.

## Seeking Developer role. Let's chat!

I'm a dance and theatre nerd who also happens to love playing around with computers. In the last couple of years I've taken up an interest in programming and have enjoyed all of the bits and bobs I've been able to make.

I love when I'm able to help someone solve a problem, and it's super validating being able to step back and see results from my work. I'm interested in becoming a professional developer someday, and I'm curious to see what kind of paths and projects might lead me there.

I recently "finished" my *web-contact-converter* project, and I'm SUPER proud to have deployed it as my first full-stack web app! 

For now, I've shifted focus to my *py-garden* project, which is really challenging my understanding of project structure, imports, and savvy class inheritance.

Please reach out to me if you have any comments about my code, or if you'd like to collaborate on any project! I'd love to hear from absolutlely anyone.
I can best be reached by email at cklsparks@gmail.com, Twitter [@collin_sparkles](https://twitter.com/collin_sparkles), or on Discord "spark.c#7001"

Cheers!
