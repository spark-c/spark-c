Hello! My name is Collin Sparks -- I'm a dance and theatre nerd who also happens to love playing around with computers. In the last couple of years I've taken up an interest in programming and have enjoyed all of the bits and bobs I've been able to make.

I’m currently working on personal projects to improve my grasp of Python and other languages as needed. I'm having a great time figuring out how to create useful things with code; I love when I'm able to help someone solve a problem, and it's super validating being able to step back and see results from my work.
    So far I've had the most fun writing the "baby-bot" discord bot, and the "web-contact-converter" web app!

I'm interested in becoming a professional developer someday, and I'm curious to see what kind of paths and projects might lead me there.

Please reach out to me if you have any comments about my code, or if you'd like to collaborate on any project! I'd love to hear from absolutlely anyone.
I can best be reached by email at cklsparks@gmail.com, or on discord "spark.c#7001"

Cheers!
