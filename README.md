# Hello! My name is Collin Sparks :)

I'm a dance and theatre nerd who also happens to love working with computers! I've spent well over a decade involved with ballet, tap, acting, stage management, and lighting design for the stage.

I've recently joined the team at [Appsmith](https://www.appsmith.com/) as a **Technical Writer**! I'm very excited and I'm having a great time working with everyone here. Come check out Appsmith, an up-and-coming low-code platform for quickly developing internal tools and dashboards! And drop by the docs pages while you're there ;) You can find the (open-source!!) repo [here](https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith).

When time permits, I'm gonna put a really nice little directory of my favorite repos here. But it is not this day... Cheers!
