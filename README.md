# Hello! My name is Collin Sparks.

I'm a dance and theatre nerd who also happens to love playing around with computers. In the last couple of years I've begun programming and have enjoyed all of the bits and bobs I've been able to make.

I love when I'm able to help someone solve a problem, and it's super validating being able to step back and see results from my work.

I recently "finished" my [*web-contact-converter*](https://github.com/spark-c/web-contact-converter) project, and I'm SUPER proud to have deployed it as my first full-stack web app! 

For now, I've shifted to my [*py-garden*](https://github.com/spark-c/py-garden) project, which is really challenging my understanding of project structure, imports, and savvy class inheritance.

Please reach out to me if you have any comments about my code, or if you'd like to collaborate on any project! I'd love to hear from absolutlely anyone.
I can best be reached by email at cklsparks@gmail.com, Twitter [@collin_sparkles](https://twitter.com/collin_sparkles), or on Discord "spark.c#7001"

Cheers!
