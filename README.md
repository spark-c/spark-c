# Hello! My name is Collin Sparks.

I'm a dance and theatre nerd who also happens to love working with computers. There's always more to learn in terms of software and technologies, and it is _amazing_ to me when I see all of the innovative ways that tech has been, and continues to be, improved; I am humbled to see the ways that people have used software as a means to overcome frightening obstacles in their lives and communities.

---

Solving a problem is super motivating for me -- and I love when I'm able to see real results from my work!

Earlier in 2021, I "finished" my [*web-contact-converter*](https://github.com/spark-c/web-contact-converter) project, and I'm super happy to have deployed it as my largest / most-useful complete full-stack web app.

For now, I've shifted to other projects, e.g. extending my [discord bot](https://github.com/spark-c/baby-bot), and practicing React.js (with my [personal site](https://spark-c.github.io) and my [coffee calculator](https://coffee-calculator-nine.vercel.app))! Repos [here](https://github.com/spark-c/spark-c.github.io) and [here](https://github.com/spark-c/coffee-calculator) respectively.

Please reach out to me if you have any comments about my code, or if you'd like to collaborate on any project! I'd love to hear from absolutlely anyone.
I can best be reached by email at cklsparks@gmail.com, Twitter [@collin_sparkles](https://twitter.com/collin_sparkles), or on Discord "spark.c#7001"

Cheers!
